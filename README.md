👋 Hi, I’m @Odd-Physce

- 👀 I’m interested in web development and video editing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack web development along with data structures & algorithms (DSA) and video editing, driven by my passion for movies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, contribute to meaningful software, and learn from the community.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

- ⚡ **Fun fact**: I approach coding like a director making a film—every line of code is a scene, each playing its part in the bigger picture of the app. Debugging is like the editing process: cutting out the bugs and refining the code until the final product shines. 🎬💻
